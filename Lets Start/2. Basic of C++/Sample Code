// My first program in C++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   cout << "Hello World! My name is Anas." << endl;
   return 0;
}

// This is a simple program designed for understanding code line by line and practicing C++ programming.
// I understand this is a basic program, but over time, we will delve into more professional aspects of C++ programming.
